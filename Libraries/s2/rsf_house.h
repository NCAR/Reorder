/*
 * Modified structures for FOF housekeeping and beams.
 *
 * Mods made in an attempt to improve generality, without loss of 
 * description.   RAR 6/27/91
 *
 * Major changes include the "unstructuring" of the beam to treat the data
 * portion separately from the housekeeping (this will necessitate the 
 * passing of two pointers when doing a "get_beam"); also, essential 
 * housekeeping is expanded to encompass CP2 256-word housekeeping.
 *
 * NOTE: 680X0/SPARC byte ordering is assumed throughout these
 * structure definitions.
