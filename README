README for REORDER VERSION 1.38-3.10 (LJM Jan 14, 2015)

BUILDING
========

Note that the SCons construction tool is now required for building reorder.
Pre-built packages for SCons are available for most common operating systems;
check the common repositories for your OS and/or the download site at 
http://www.scons.org.

Unpack the reorder tar file and move to the resulting directory:

    $ tar xvzf Reorder_3.00.tar.gz
    $ cd Reorder/trunk

To build reorder without netCDF support:

    $ scons
    
Or, if you have netCDF libraries installed and want netCDF support in reorder:

    $ scons useNetcdf=True
    
The two reorder programs qreod and qreou will be created in the 'bin' 
directory below your current directory.

NOTE: The build method assumes that GNU compilers (gcc, gfortran, and/or g77)
will be used.  If you do not have GNU compilers, the build may still work,
but you need to explicitly disable use of a GNU-specific compiler flag by adding
'use_m32=False' to the appropriate scons command line above.


CHANGE LOG
==========

REORDER VERSION 3.10 January 14 2015 (LJM)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
No changes other than removing ncurses references since that library is not
needed.  However, there is no record that version 3.00 was ever committed.
See logmsg.5 for details of significant changes as well as what is detailed
below. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F
      routine reo prints 'qreo1.F--LINUX VERSION 3.10 January 2015'

2. Libraries/dap/qdap.F
      routine accver prints 'qdap.F--LINUX VERSION 3.10 January 2015'

3. Libraries/s2/SConscript
      removed 'ncurses' from env.AppendUnique(LIBS       = ['m','ncurses'])
                             env.AppendUnique(LIBS       = ['m'])
      since it is not needed.  Reorder will now build as 32-bit executable
      on 64-bit machines.

==========
 
REORDER VERSION 3.00 November 2011 (LJM)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Significant changes were made to how Reorder populates the output XYZ grid 
and to what is included in the calculation of heights (MSL).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F
      routine reo prints 'qreo1.F--LINUX VERSION 3.00 November 2011'

2. Libraries/dap/qdap.F
      routine accver prints 'qdap.F--LINUX VERSION 3.00 November 2011'

3. For now bounds checking (env.AppendUnique(FORTRANFLAGS = ['-fbounds-check'])
   remains ON in SConstruct.  This line could be commented out (#) to prevent
   the program from dying, but this could lead to unpredictable results in some
   instances.  There are likely some lingering problems where the program can
   go beyond the bounds of dimensioned variables.  Unfortunately, these tend to
   be unique to a particular set of user-specied variables and parameters when
   applied to their dataset.

4. Airborne Doppler;
   a. Added some more detailed print statements for a thorough re-examination of
      some parts of the code, especially as it applies to gridding an airborne
      dataset. A current issue is whether or not refraction and Earth's curvature
      are included compared to height calculations above a local tangent plane
      (flat Earth with no correction for refraction).

      The issue in #4a above haa come up during gridding of a synthetic dataset
      based on a Beltrami flow model (sequence of counter-rotating vortices that 
      satisfy mass-continuity).  Specific changes and/or fixes relevant to these
      tests follow.

   b. Changed how the region of XYZ output grid points [size of boxes surrounding
      the input range gate (RAE) sample locations] get defined.  The antenna
      spins around the centerline of the fuselage as the aircraft moves forward,
      thus making a series of surveillance-like scans spaced a few hundred meters
      apart along the flight track.  Therefore, it is more appropriate to keep
      the horizontal box dimensions fixed (CARTESIAN) and to let the vertical 
      dimension increase with range (SPHERICAL and/or HYBRID) from the radar.

   c. qreo1.F (call filter) and qreo2.F (subroutine filter): added logical
      variable airpln to parameter list.  The user specifies the BOX 
      DIMENSIONS variable, with parameter of CARTESIAN, SPHERICAL, or HYBRID,
      along with the desired XYZ and RAE radii, and Reorder makes the choice
      of XY and Z (or E) box dimensions to be used.  See comments inside
      qreo2.F, subroutine filter.

   d. qreo1.F (call inidat) and qreo1.F (subroutine inidat): added logical
      variable adaptive to parameter list.  This new logical variable is
      used to determine the algorithm for populating the output grid points
      surrounding an input range gate location.  The intent is to let the
      program adapt its box size (linear dimensions) to a local RAE sampling
      resolution (spherical dimensions).  

      If the adaptive scheme is desired, the user must specify a new variable
      and its parameter (POPULATE: ADAPTIVE;) in their script; otherwise, this
      variable is not included and the program uses the original (default) 
      scheme.

      Adaptive = .false. ==> Populates all output grid points (the historic
                             or original algorithm)  
               = .true.  ==> Populates only the nearest output grid points

      This adaptive scheme uncouples spatial filtering (distance-weighted
      averages (Cressman, Exponential, and Uniform) from which output
      grid points get populated.  The original approach used the same
      XYZ-radii and/or RAE-radii for both the output grid region to be
      populated and how the filtering is to be done.

5. Some fixes were made to how Reorder parses the user-specified variables
   and parameters (the input script).  These fixes included initializing
   some variables and/or resetting their values back to an initial value
      
6. I now think I understand the basic path through the Reorder code.
   There are several somewhat extraneous calls from subroutine reo 
   in qreo1.F, but the most relevant to understanding the logic of
   Reorder are calls from reo.  This list of those routines and
   their functions are listed below.

   a. The main program (qreoroot.F) in either ./Applications/qreod 
      (Dorade) or ./Applications/qreou (Universal) format calls the
      overall driver subroutine reo in ./Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F that
      loops over all beams within a volume with START and STOP times
      specified by the user.
   b. The list of most-relevant subroutines called from subroutine
      reo:
      inidat - 
      setcat -
      inireo -

      Top of loop through the requested input volume (3-D RAE scan)

      genhead -

2.40+  LJay Miller (also see logmsg.3, logmsg.4):

       Continuing to find and fix memory access problems, especially now
       that bounds-checking is turned on inside SConstruct by Chris Burghart.

       env.AppendUnique(FORTRANFLAGS = ['-fbounds-check'])

       The dimensions of several arrays scattered throughout have been
       increased.  More diagnostic print statements have been included.
       Many of these are turned on with data diag_ljm/.true./ in the 
       qreo1.F/subroutine reo module.  The logical variable diag_ljm
       is passed around to other subroutines.  I've yet to learn how to
       use the debugger, besides finding all of these sorts of problems
       seems very tedious and apparently dependent on how and what is
       done by individual users as well as the version of Linux that
       others are using.

       In the case of Stacy Brodzik's (Univ. Wash.) P3 dataset from GRIP,
       I got reorder to work here (Red Hat Linux), but it still does not 
       work at UW (Debian Linux).  A similar issue came up with Nolan
       Atkins (Lyndon State College of Vermont) who is using Ubuntu Linux.
   

2.00   LJay Miller (also see logmsg.0, logmsg.1, logmsg.2): 
       Updated README in Feb-Mar, 2010 to elaborate on changes (1.38-1.40)
       made prior to my changes listed here for 1.41 that were done inside 
       Reorder/original138/reorder138 rather than inside Reorder/trunk.

       With Chris' help, copied my modifications in ./Reorder/*138/*138/*.F
       to ./Reorder/trunk which is now the proper working directory.  Built
       with scons instead of make as was being done in ./Reorder/*138/*138.

       I had spent considerable time in 2009 going through key portions of
       the Fortran code to understand those details that relate to the actual
       interpolation algorithm, particularly the interplay between the region
       of influence and weighting functions in mapping measurements from 
       the radar range-azimuth-elevation space to the final Cartesian (xyz)
       grid.

       1. Cosmetic changes: added some comments for clarification of code 
          along with diagnostic print statements that mostly have been 
          commented out now. Added a logical variable (diag_ljm) to turn
          on (.true.) or off (.false.) some key diagnostic print statements.
       2. Uncovered a handful of user-specified variables (attributes) that
          were not documented.  Some of these are corrections to navigating
          airborne data that are most often taken care of in soloii.  However,
          as near as I can tell, adding ADJUST_Z is important so as to include
          a 4/3 earth correction to radar heights. 
       3. Bug-fix: Changed signs of slong and dlong from (-) to (+) when the
          user includes SPRINT_XLT (forces call to routine sprint_xyz).  See
          explanations in qreo1.F and qreo2.F where it is noted that the MMM
          routines xy2lldrv and ll2xydrv are no longer being called.
       4. Added a new user-specified variable "BOX DIMENSIONS" to explicitly
          specify which radii to use: CARTESIAN, SPHERICAL, or HYBRID, where
          HYBRID uses CARTESIAN close to the radar and shifts smoothly over
          to SPHERICAL (range-dependent) dimensions to increase the size of
          the region of influence as range from the radar increases.
       5. Improved calculations of box dimensions so that when XRADIUS=0,
          the program sets XRADIUS=YRADIUS.  Likewise, when RGRADIUS=0,
          RGRADIUS=AZRADIUS converted to arc length.  The intent is to 
          equalize the scales within each plane scanned (PPI or RHI) passed
          by the Reorder weighting function
 
1.40a  Chris Burghart:
       Added old_docs with reoexample.ps, unixqreola.ps, and unixreorder.ps
       documentation files copied from 

1.40a  Chris Burghart:
       Fixed a bug in Libraries/qreo/qreo2.F that shows up when compiled
       under gfortran and involves xmin, ymin, and zmin inside the filter 
       subroutine contained in qreo2.F (Tues 14 Jul 2009 email).  These
       variables need to be "saved" or else the grid will be empty.  Another 
       variable (ltp) must also be initialized to 0 (see qcommon.reo;10 in 
       qreo1.F and ludat in subroutine setcat in qufap.F) for the gfortran 
       compiler (19 or 20 Nov 2009 email).

1.40   Chris Burghart:
       Reorder is now built with SCons rather than configure/make. DORADE
       access utilities are included with the distribution, so reorder is now
       independent of soloii.  The code now also builds and executes on Mac 
       OS X machines, although it has not been extensively tested.

1.39   Dennis Flanigan:
       It's not clear what if any changes were made in going from 1.38-->1.39,
       except that soloii is not inside original139. Email from Burghart on
       10 Jul 2009 suggests that Chris had started working on adding explicit
       building of a 32-bit binary on 64-bit systems.  I suspect this is 
       now in the trunk directory inside the scons stuff.

1.38   Dennis Flanigan:
       Added cvt_toLatLon code to ./Reorder/trunk/Libraries/qreo/xcedcio.c
       in response to Sandra Yuter's concerns about the conversions to lat/lon
       at latitudes furhter from the equator.  Her shipboard dataset is actually
       from the southern hemisphere.  This change was done in going from 1.37 to
       1.38
