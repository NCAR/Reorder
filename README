README for reorder 1.40

BUILDING
========

Note that the SCons construction tool is now required for building reorder.
Pre-built packages for SCons are available for most common operating systems;
check the common repositories for your OS and/or the download site at 
http://www.scons.org.

Unpack the reorder tar file and move to the resulting directory:

    $ tar xvzf reorder140.tar.gz
    $ cd reorder-1.40

To build reorder without netCDF support:

    $ scons
    
Or, if you have netCDF libraries installed and want netCDF support in reorder:

    $ scons useNetcdf=True
    
The two reorder programs qreod and qreou will be created in the 'bin' 
directory below your current directory.

NOTE: The build method assumes that GNU compilers (gcc, gfortran, and/or g77)
will be used.  If you do not have GNU compilers, the build may still work,
but you need to explicitly disable use of a GNU-specific compiler flag by adding
'use_m32=False' to the appropriate scons command line above.


CHANGE LOG
==========

1.40 - Reorder is now built with SCons rather than configure/make. DORADE
  access utilities are included with the distribution, so reorder is now
  independent of soloii.  The code now also builds and executes on Mac 
  OS X machines, although it has not been extensively tested.
