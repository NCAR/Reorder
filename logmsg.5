REORDER VERSION 3.00 November 2011 (LJM)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Significant changes were made to how Reorder populates the output XYZ grid 
and to what is included in the calculation of heights (MSL).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F
      routine reo prints 'qreo1.F--LINUX VERSION 3.00 November 2011'

2. Libraries/dap/qdap.F
      routine accver prints 'qdap.F--LINUX VERSION 3.00 November 2011'

3. For now bounds checking (env.AppendUnique(FORTRANFLAGS = ['-fbounds-check'])
   remains ON in SConstruct.  This line could be commented out (#) to prevent
   the program from dying, but this could lead to unpredictable results in some
   instances.  There are likely some lingering problems where the program can
   go beyond the bounds of dimensioned variables.  Unfortunately, these tend to
   be unique to a particular set of user-specied variables and parameters when
   applied to their dataset.

4. Airborne Doppler;
   a. Added some more detailed print statements for a thorough re-examination of
      some parts of the code, especially as it applies to gridding an airborne
      dataset. A current issue is whether or not refraction and Earth's curvature
      are included compared to height calculations above a local tangent plane
      (flat Earth with no correction for refraction).

      The issue in #4a above haa come up during gridding of a synthetic dataset
      based on a Beltrami flow model (sequence of counter-rotating vortices that 
      satisfy mass-continuity).  Specific changes and/or fixes relevant to these
      tests follow.

   b. Changed how the region of XYZ output grid points [size of boxes surrounding
      the input range gate (RAE) sample locations] get defined.  The antenna
      spins around the centerline of the fuselage as the aircraft moves forward,
      thus making a series of surveillance-like scans spaced a few hundred meters
      apart along the flight track.  Therefore, it is more appropriate to keep
      the horizontal box dimensions fixed (CARTESIAN) and to let the vertical 
      dimension increase with range (SPHERICAL and/or HYBRID) from the radar.

   c. qreo1.F (call filter) and qreo2.F (subroutine filter): added logical
      variable airpln to parameter list.  The user specifies the BOX 
      DIMENSIONS variable, with parameter of CARTESIAN, SPHERICAL, or HYBRID,
      along with the desired XYZ and RAE radii, and Reorder makes the choice
      of XY and Z (or E) box dimensions to be used.  See comments inside
      qreo2.F, subroutine filter.

   d. qreo1.F (call inidat) and qreo1.F (subroutine inidat): added logical
      variable adaptive to parameter list.  This new logical variable is
      used to determine the algorithm for populating the output grid points
      surrounding an input range gate location.  The intent is to let the
      program adapt its box size (linear dimensions) to a local RAE sampling
      resolution (spherical dimensions).  

      If the adaptive scheme is desired, the user must specify a new variable
      and its parameter (POPULATE: ADAPTIVE;) in their script; otherwise, this
      variable is not included and the program uses the original (default) 
      scheme.

      Adaptive = .false. ==> Populates all output grid points (the historic
                             or original algorithm)  
               = .true.  ==> Populates only the nearest output grid points

      This adaptive scheme uncouples spatial filtering (distance-weighted
      averages (Cressman, Exponential, and Uniform) from which output
      grid points get populated.  The original approach used the same
      XYZ-radii and/or RAE-radii for both the output grid region to be
      populated and how the filtering is to be done.

5. Some fixes were made to how Reorder parses the user-specified variables
   and parameters (the input script).  These fixes included initializing
   some variables and/or resetting their values back to an initial value
