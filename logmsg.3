REORDER VERSION 2.40 January 2011 (LJM)

1. Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F - 
                 routine reo prints 'qreo1.F--LINUX VERSION 2.40 January 2011'
   Libraries/dap/qdap.F - 
                 routine accver() prints 'qDAP unix VERSION November 1997'
   Applications/qreou/unixqufap.F - 
                 routine accver() prints 'qUFAP--LINUX VERSION 2.30 December 2010'
   Applications/qreod/qreoroot.F - 
                 prints 'qreod - REORDER executable for reading Dorade sweep files'
   Applications/qreou/qreoroot.F - 
                 prints 'qreou - REORDER executable for reading Universal format files'

2. Libraries/qreo/foflib - added "INTEGER FUNCTION GETLEN (STRING)" to trap those
             instances when the user-supplied input/script has any blank lines since
             the program requires (;) instead.  Fixes this and allows program to
             continue execution.

3. Found and fixed additional minor instances where results of Fortran len command
   could give erroneous results.  Added comments and diagnostic prints (now are
   commented out) in areas where parsing the user-supplied input could produce
   run-time errors due to going out-of-bounds on character strings.  

   For now bounds checking (env.AppendUnique(FORTRANFLAGS = ['-fbounds-check'])
   is left ON in SConstruct.  This line could be commented out (#) to prevent
   the program from dying, but this could lead to unpredictable results in some
   instances.  See subroutine readln in Libraries/qreo/foflib.F and all calls 
   to this and similar routines.

4. Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F - added a new field ZMSL (height above a curved Earth)
             that can be calculated from the range gate location (R,A,E) that 
             includes 4/3 Earth correction.  Still unable to sort out with any
             degree of certainty that this height-correction is done with the 
             user-supplied ADJUST_Z command.
