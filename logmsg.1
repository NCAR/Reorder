Reorder has always had the apparent capability to grid at least 16 fields.
Depending on the number and particular fields asked for, mxfld=16 is not
reachable without generating lots of bogus values.  This problem was 
partially fixed by increasing some array sizes (increased mxfld, mxsfld, 
and mxcomp) along with a few other related arrays.  There remain a few
bogus values scattered throughout the output fields.
