REORDER VERSION 2.41 August 2011 (LJM)

1. Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F - 
                 routine reo prints 'qreo1.F--LINUX VERSION 2.41 August 2011'

2. For now bounds checking (env.AppendUnique(FORTRANFLAGS = ['-fbounds-check'])
   is left ON in SConstruct.  This line could be commented out (#) to prevent
   the program from dying, but this could lead to unpredictable results in some
   instances.  This is true in several routines where there do loops over which
   dimensioned arrays are not properly dimensioned.

3. Libraries/qreo/qreo2.F - Out-of-bounds accessing problems with Stacy Brodzik's
   GRIP (P3 airborne, dorade sweep files)
        subroutine xyz( n, r, x, y, z, ...) call from qreo1.F
	 - changed dimension r(1), x(1), y(1), z(1) 
                to dimension r(n), x(n), y(n), z(n)
	subroutine insoff( xo, yo, zo, n, x, y, z)
	 - changed dimension x(1), y(1), z(1)
                to dimension x(n), y(n), z(n)

4. Libraries/qreo/qreo2.F - Out-of-bounds accessing problems could occur if 
   routines advxyz and adhxyz were ever called.  Fixed the dimension statements
   in both routines to include dimensioning variable passed into the routines.

5. Libraries/qreo/qreo2.F - Fixed "warnings" regarding function loop_xy2ll_v4
   and function loop_ll2xy_v4, where both returned loop_....._v3 = num_pts
   instead of loop_....._v4 = num_pts.  It is not clear if these two functions
   are stilled up, but if loop_....._v4 was needed somewhere it would not be
   correct.

6. Libraries/qreo/qreo1.F - call adhxyz parameter list included variable zok
   which was not included in qreo2.F subroutine adhxyz.  The variable zok was
   never referenced in the subroutine so it was deleted from the call.

These kinds of problems continue to exist throughout Reorder code and are
being fixed as they are uncovered.  This is a painful process since each
user run can expose these problems, but only when their script for their
particular user-specified choices are made.
