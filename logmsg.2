Added traps to force Reorder to die with a Floating Exception when more fields
are asked for than are readable by CEDRIC (currently 25) and a trap when the 
user asks for a QUALITY field to be calculated on a non-velocity field.  Also, 
added comments to the code describing portions that were finally understood 
to aid in debugging.
